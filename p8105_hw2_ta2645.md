# Problem 1

### Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel Dataset

``` r
trash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
             skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select("dumpster":"homes_powered") %>% 
  drop_na("dumpster") %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
```

### Read and clean precipitation data

``` r
#2018 Data:
precipitation_2018 =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na("month") %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

#2019 Data:
precipitation_2019 = 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx",
             sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
             skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(c("month")) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)
```

### Combine participation data sets

Here, we also convert *month* to a character variable.

``` r
precipitation_combined =
  bind_rows(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2019) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[as.numeric(month)],
    month = str_to_lower((month))
  )
```

### Mr. Trash Wheel data description

The Mr. Trash Wheel data contains **454** observations and **14**
variables. These variables list characteristics like number, weight and
volume for each dumpster. They also describe each type of litter, such
as plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, and more. The median
number of sports balls in a dumpster was **8** in 2017.

### Precipitation data description

The precipitation data contains **24** observations and **3** variables.
These variables include month, total precipitation and year. The total
precipitation, according to available data, was **70.33 in** in 2018.

# Problem 2

## Clean the *FiveThirtyEight* data

### We start with `pols-month.csv`. Instructions include:

-   Clean the data in pols-month.csv
-   Use `separate()` to break up the variable mon into integer variables
    year, month, and day
-   Replace month number with month name
-   Create a president variable taking values gop and dem
-   Remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop
-   Remove the day variable

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate("mon", into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[as.numeric(month)],
    month = str_to_lower(month),
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) %>% 
  select(-starts_with("prez"),-day)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Now we work on the `snp.csv` data

Instructions include:

-   Arrange according to year and month
-   Organize so that year and month are the leading columns

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate("date", into = c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    year, year = if_else(year <= 15, year + 2000, year + 1900)) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[as.numeric(month)],
    month = str_to_lower(month),
    year = as.character(year)) %>%
  select(year, month, close, -day)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Next, we clean `unemployment.csv`

We are instructed to tidy unemployment data so that it can be merged
with the other datasets. Steps include:

-   Switching from “wide” to “long” format
-   Ensuring that key variables have the same name
-   Ensuring that key variables take the same values

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read.csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.character(year))
```

### Finally, we join the datasets

We merge `snp` into `pols` and then merge `unemployment` into the
result.

``` r
pols_snp_merged = 
  left_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = "year")

final_merge = 
  left_join(pols_snp_merged, unemployment_df, by = "year")
```

#### Description of *FiveThirtyEight* data

The `pols` data has **822** observations and **9** variables. These
variables tell us how many politicians identify as democratic (`dem`) or
republican (`gop`) between 1947 and 2015.

The `snp` data has **787** observations and **3** variables. These
variables tell us about the S&P stock market index from 1950 to 2015.
This includes the year, month and close values.

The `unemploy` data has **816** observations and **3** variables. It
shows the unemployment rate for each month throughout the year from the
years 1948 and 2015.

The merged dataset containing all three (`pols`, `snp` and
`unemployment`) has **113124** observations and **13** variables. It
shows that between 1947 and 2015 with a republican (`gop`) president,
the S&P index was **378.27** and the unemployment rate was **5.93%**.
When a democrat (`dem`) was president during this time period, the S&P
index was **577.73**.

The data file also shows us information on governors, senators and
representatives from both parties, as well as data broken down by month
and not just year. For our puroses, we focused on year-level data and
only looked at presidents.
